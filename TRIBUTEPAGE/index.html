            <h3 class="Body">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre
                  of Rameswaram on Pamban Island.His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, his mother
                  Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
                  uninhabited Dhanushkodi.<br><br>Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to 
                  and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers 
                  in order to add to the family's meager income.In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and 
                  hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
                  After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, 
                  Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in
                  1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.<br><br>While Kalam was working on a senior
                  class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within
                  the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a
                  difficult deadline"</h3>

                <h3 class="Head">Career as a scientist</h3>
                <h3 class="Body">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment 
                    of the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
                    (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
                    Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
                <br><br>In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first 
                Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980.
                <br><br>In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.
                Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.
                In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.
                <br><br>His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.
                Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical 
                surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.
                In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer 
                sfor health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".

                <h3 class = "Body">Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.
                    He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.
                    <br><br> Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:

                    I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.
                    He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.
                    <br><br>In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.
                    At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.
